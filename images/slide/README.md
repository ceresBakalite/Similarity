## Similarity Screen Views
### *Seeking patterns of similarity between data strings* <div id="logo-container"><img id="logo-shell" class="img-logo" align="right" src="https://ceresbakalite.github.io/similarity/images/NAVSimilarityLogoStyle.png"></div>
The following slider showcases a small number of screen views highlighting the Similarity client side application GUI.

There have been a number of requests to see a preview in this forum and as such have found a placeholder here.
***

**The views highlight the following attributes**

	The command line can take zero, two or up to nine arguments. Zero arguments will launch the
	application, whereas any argument passed to the application will return an integer representing
	a percentage matching value

	For example:

	[location]\similarity.exe "comparison one"  "comparison two"

  If you wish to use the boolean parameters the only required argument other than the comparison strings is the MatchingAlgorithm attribute, otherwise the shell will not know what you are trying to do. The boolean attributes need to be in order but you don't need to use them all.  If you wish to make, for example, the fourth boolean argument (ReverseComparison) true, then you will need to let Similarity know what the preceding arguments are, otherwise it won't know which attribute you are referring to.
