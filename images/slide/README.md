## Similarity Screen Views
### *Seeking patterns of similarity between data strings* <div id="logo-container"><img id="logo-shell" title="No readable content. Just a page logo" class="img-logo" align="right" src="./NAVSimilarityLogoStyle.png"></div>
The following slider showcases a small number of screen views highlighting the Similarity client-side application GUI.

There have been a number of requests to see a preview in this forum and as such have found a placeholder here.

Weâ€™ve crafted extensive data repositories including common abbreviations, acronyms, business language and even jargon, that reside in the cloud. These libraries can be enhanced, either on a user, client or global basis to target specific types of data and can be used to facilitate accurate blending of otherwise disparate data sets. Your original data content is always preserved.

You can select and save from multiple preference types when defining search patterns.

Phonetic matching alleviates sound pronunciation where spelling can be overlooked. Words can be created, removed and normalized automatically, all without altering your original data content. The cutoff point is simply wherever the matching comparisons found are determined to be so numerous as to be of no interest.
***

**The views highlight the following attributes**

	1. Side by side comparison
	2. Select and confirm duplicates
	3. Review and select abbreviations
	4. Add or remove abbreviations
	5. Detailed duplicate analysis
	6. Remove rows from either pane
	7. Automatically remove exact duplicates
	8. Preset comparison preferences

These images simply represent a small subset of the application GUI.
